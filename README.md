# Accident-Data-Analysis-using-Power-BI
In this project, I have tried creating a simple dashboard and get insight to accident patterns and its trend along a particular year. I have analysed and then cleansed the data into usable form. Data categorization is also done to properly sort and display insightful meaning. Categorized the data into accident types fatal, serious and slight and used a slicer to differentiate the values.
